## Sample 1: Opinion Essay

### Đề Bài
> *Some people believe that students should do community service as part of their education. Do you agree or disagree?*

### Bài Mẫu (223 từ)

```
Many people think that students should do community service as part of 
their studies. I completely agree with this idea because it helps 
students learn important skills and become better people.

First, community service helps students learn useful skills that they 
cannot learn in the classroom. When students help clean a park or visit 
old people in nursing homes, they learn how to work with others and how 
to communicate with different people. For example, my friend joined a 
program to teach children in a poor village last summer. She learned to 
be patient and creative. These skills will help her in her future job.

Second, community service makes students more caring and responsible. 
When young people see problems in their community, they want to help 
solve them. They understand that they are part of society and should 
do something good for others. This makes them better citizens.

Some people may say that students are too busy with their studies. 
However, community service does not need much time. Students can do 
it on weekends or during school holidays.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that community service should be 
part of education. It teaches important life skills and helps students 
become caring members of society. Schools should encourage all students 
to participate in these activities.

## Sample 2: Problem-Solution Essay

### Đề Bài
> *Many young people today spend too much time on social media. What problems does this cause? What solutions can you suggest?*

### Bài Mẫu (218 từ)

```
Nowadays, many young people use social media for many hours every day. 
This causes several problems, but there are some solutions that can help.

There are two main problems with spending too much time on social media. 
First, it is bad for young people's health. When they sit and look at 
their phones all day, they do not exercise. This can make them fat and 
weak. Also, looking at bright screens can hurt their eyes. Second, social 
media can make young people feel sad. When they see photos of other 
people's perfect lives, they feel bad about themselves.

However, there are some ways to solve these problems. Parents should 
limit how much time their children can use social media. For example, 
they can allow only one or two hours per day. Schools should also teach 
students about the dangers of too much screen time. They can organize 
more sports activities so students have other things to do instead of 
using phones.

In conclusion, spending too much time on social media causes health and 
mental problems for young people. Parents and schools should work 
together to help young people use social media in a healthy way. If 
everyone works together, we can solve this problem.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about a laptop that I bought from your website 
on January 5th. The product code is ABC-1234.

When I received the laptop and started using it, I noticed two problems. 
First, the battery does not work properly. It only lasts for about one 
hour before it needs charging again. Second, the screen sometimes 
becomes black for no reason.

I have tried to restart the laptop many times, but the problems continue. 
This is very frustrating because I need the laptop for my work.

I would like you to send me a new laptop or give me a full refund. 
Please reply within 7 days.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
Nguyen Van A
