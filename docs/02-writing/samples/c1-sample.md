The pervasive influence of technology on contemporary society has sparked 
a polarized debate regarding its overall impact on human life. While 
technological innovations have undoubtedly streamlined numerous aspects 
of daily existence, they have simultaneously introduced unprecedented 
complexities. This essay will critically examine both perspectives before 
articulating my reasoned position.

Advocates of technological advancement contend that it has revolutionized 
the way we work, communicate, and access information. The automation of 
mundane tasks has liberated individuals from time-consuming labor, enabling 
them to focus on more intellectually stimulating pursuits. Furthermore, 
digital platforms have democratized access to education and knowledge, 
empowering people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to enhance their 
skills. The medical field, in particular, has witnessed transformative 
breakthroughs, with sophisticated diagnostic tools and telemedicine 
expanding healthcare accessibility to previously underserved populations.

Conversely, critics argue that technology has engendered a host of 
unforeseen complications. The relentless connectivity fostered by digital 
devices has eroded the distinction between professional and personal 
spheres, contributing to widespread burnout and deteriorating mental 
health. Moreover, the exponential acceleration of technological change 
has created a digital divide, marginalizing those who lack the resources 
or aptitude to adapt. Concerns regarding algorithmic bias, data privacy 
breaches, and the proliferation of misinformation further underscore the 
problematic dimensions of our increasingly digitized world.

In my assessment, while technology has introduced legitimate challenges, 
its transformative potential for human advancement is undeniable. The 
crucial determinant lies not in the technology itself, but in our collective 
capacity to implement robust regulatory frameworks and cultivate digital 
literacy. By adopting a balanced approach that harnesses innovation while 
mitigating its adverse consequences, society can navigate the complexities 
of the digital age.

In conclusion, the relationship between technology and quality of life 
is nuanced and multifaceted. Through thoughtful governance and individual 
responsibility, we can optimize its benefits while safeguarding against 
its potential pitfalls.

## Sample 2: Problem-Solution Essay

### Đề Bài
> *Environmental pollution is becoming increasingly serious in many cities around the world. What are the causes of this problem? What measures can be taken to address it?*

### Bài Mẫu (298 từ)

```
The escalating severity of environmental pollution in urban centers 
constitutes one of the most pressing challenges confronting modern 
civilization. This essay will analyze the primary drivers of this 
phenomenon and propose comprehensive measures to mitigate its impact.

The deterioration of urban air and water quality can be attributed to 
multiple interconnected factors. Foremost among these is the unprecedented 
rate of industrialization, which has resulted in the unregulated discharge 
of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere and waterways. The exponential 
growth of vehicle ownership, particularly in developing nations experiencing 
rapid economic expansion, has further exacerbated air quality degradation. 
Additionally, inadequate waste management infrastructure in many metropolitan 
areas has led to the accumulation of non-biodegradable materials, 
contaminating soil and groundwater systems.

Addressing this multifaceted crisis necessitates a coordinated approach 
involving governmental intervention, corporate responsibility, and 
individual behavioral modification. At the policy level, governments 
should implement stringent emission standards and incentivize the 
transition to renewable energy sources through subsidies and tax reforms. 
The establishment of comprehensive public transportation networks would 
reduce dependence on private vehicles, thereby decreasing carbon emissions. 
Furthermore, corporations must be held accountable for their environmental 
footprint through mandatory sustainability reporting and penalties for 
non-compliance.

At the grassroots level, fostering environmental consciousness through 
education campaigns can catalyze behavioral changes in consumption patterns 
and waste disposal practices. Community-based initiatives, such as recycling 
programs and urban greening projects, can complement top-down regulatory 
measures.

In conclusion, while urban pollution represents a formidable challenge 
rooted in industrialization and inadequate infrastructure, it can be 
effectively addressed through a synergistic combination of policy 
interventions, corporate accountability, and civic engagement. Only 
through sustained, collaborative efforts can we preserve the habitability 
of our urban environments for future generations.

## Sample 3: Formal Letter of Suggestion (Task 1)

### Đề Bài
> *You have noticed that your local community has a problem with littering and waste management. Write a letter to the local council. In your letter:*
> - *describe the problems you have observed*
> - *explain the effects on the community*
> - *suggest some solutions*

### Bài Mẫu (172 từ)

```
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention the deteriorating waste management 
situation in the Binh Thanh District, which has significantly impacted 
the quality of life for local residents.

Over the past several months, I have observed a marked increase in littering 
along major thoroughfares and in public spaces. Overflowing rubbish bins 
and illegally dumped waste have become commonplace, particularly in the 
vicinity of the central market. This has resulted in persistent unpleasant 
odors, an unsightly environment, and potential public health hazards due 
to vermin infestation.

The ramifications extend beyond aesthetics. The accumulation of waste in 
drainage systems has contributed to localized flooding during the monsoon 
season, causing property damage and traffic disruption.

I would respectfully suggest implementing more frequent waste collection 
schedules, installing additional public bins, and launching public awareness 
campaigns emphasizing civic responsibility. Furthermore, introducing 
penalties for illegal dumping may serve as an effective deterrent.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss these proposals further.

Yours faithfully,
Le Hoang C
