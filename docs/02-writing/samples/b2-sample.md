## Sample 1: Opinion Essay

### Đề Bài
> *Some people believe that students should do community service as part of their education. Do you agree or disagree?*

### Bài Mẫu (296 từ)

In recent years, there has been growing support for incorporating community 
service into educational curricula. I firmly agree that schools should 
require students to participate in community service, as it provides 
invaluable life lessons and contributes to personal development.

The primary reason for my view is that community service enables students 
to develop essential soft skills that are difficult to acquire in traditional 
classroom settings. When engaging in volunteer activities, such as organizing 
charity events or assisting at local shelters, students learn teamwork, 
communication, and problem-solving in real-world contexts. For instance, 
a student who volunteers at a food bank must coordinate with others, manage 
time effectively, and adapt to unexpected situations. These transferable 
skills are highly valued by employers and are crucial for future career success.

Furthermore, community service cultivates empathy and social responsibility 
among young people. By directly witnessing challenges faced by disadvantaged 
members of society, students develop a deeper understanding of social issues. 
This exposure encourages them to become more compassionate and active citizens 
who contribute positively to their communities. Research from Harvard 
University suggests that students who engage in volunteer work are more 
likely to participate in civic activities as adults.

Admittedly, some may argue that students already face considerable academic 
pressure and adding community service requirements would be burdensome. 
However, this concern can be addressed by integrating service activities 
with academic subjects or offering flexible scheduling during holidays. 
The benefits of community service far outweigh the minor inconveniences 
of time management.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that community service should be a 
mandatory component of education. It equips students with practical skills, 
fosters social awareness, and prepares them to be responsible members of 
society. Educational institutions should actively promote and facilitate 
such programs for all students.

## Sample 2: Discussion Essay

### Đề Bài
> *Some people think that technology has made our lives easier, while others believe it has made life more complicated. Discuss both views and give your opinion.*

### Bài Mẫu (287 từ)

The impact of technology on modern life is a subject of considerable debate. 
While some argue that technological advancements have simplified our daily 
routines, others contend that they have introduced new complexities. This 
essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.

On the one hand, proponents of technology argue that it has undeniably 
made life more convenient. Tasks that once required significant time and 
effort can now be completed within seconds. For example, online banking 
allows people to transfer money instantly without visiting a physical 
branch, while e-commerce platforms enable consumers to purchase products 
from the comfort of their homes. Furthermore, communication technology 
has bridged geographical distances, enabling people to maintain relationships 
with friends and family across the globe through video calls and messaging apps.

On the other hand, critics contend that technology has created unexpected 
complications. The constant connectivity enabled by smartphones and the 
internet has blurred the boundaries between work and personal life, leading 
to increased stress and burnout. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological 
change requires individuals to continuously update their skills, creating 
anxiety for those who struggle to keep up. The proliferation of digital 
devices has also raised concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and the 
authenticity of online information.

In my opinion, while technology has introduced certain challenges, its 
benefits substantially outweigh its drawbacks. The key lies in how we 
choose to use technology. By setting healthy boundaries and developing 
digital literacy, we can harness the advantages of technology while 
minimizing its negative effects.

In conclusion, technology has both simplified and complicated aspects 
of modern life. However, with mindful usage, we can maximize its benefits 
and lead more efficient, connected lives.

## Sample 3: Letter of Complaint (Task 1)

### Đề Bài
> *You recently stayed at a hotel that was recommended by your travel agent, but you were very disappointed. Write a letter to your travel agent. In your letter:*
> - *explain where and when you stayed*
> - *describe the problems you experienced*  
> - *say what you expect the travel agent to do*

### Bài Mẫu (158 từ)

```
Dear Mr. Johnson,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the hotel accommodation 
you recommended for my recent trip to Da Nang from December 20th to 25th.

Upon arrival at the Sunshine Hotel, I discovered that my reserved room 
was not available, and I was assigned a smaller room without a sea view, 
contrary to what was promised. Furthermore, the air conditioning system 
malfunctioned throughout my stay, making the room uncomfortably hot. 
When I reported this to the reception, they were unhelpful and dismissive 
of my concerns.

Additionally, the hotel facilities were far below the standard advertised 
in your brochure. The swimming pool was under maintenance, and the 
restaurant had limited menu options.

Given these disappointing experiences, I believe I am entitled to 
compensation. I would appreciate either a partial refund or a discount 
on my next booking through your agency.

I look forward to your prompt response within 14 days.

Yours sincerely,
Tran Minh B
