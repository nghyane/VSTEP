    "passage": "Jazz is a musical form that has clear differences from other types of music, and understanding these differences is central to appreciating its value. The passage below discusses what sets jazz apart, dividing the discussion into two major areas: the history and development of jazz, and the techniques that define it.\n\nBefore jazz became popular in the early twentieth century, ragtime was the dominant form of popular dance music in the United States. Ragtime featured structured, composed melodies played on the piano, and it appeared before jazz as a well-known musical style. As ragtime faded, jazz emerged with a fresh and exciting approach to performance. Unlike classical or composed music, jazz musicians do not simply play notes written on a page. Instead, they consciously — that is, purposely — reshape melodies during a live performance. This process is known as improvisation, which means creating musical variations while performing rather than following a fixed arrangement. Through improvisation, jazz musicians are able to demonstrate their individual artistry.\n\nIn the early days of jazz, certain musicians were known as \"get-off\" musicians. These performers would provide solo performances within a band or orchestra, stepping forward from the group to play unadorned — that is, plain and unembellished — versions of a melody before adding their own creative variations. One of the most influential figures in jazz history was Louis Armstrong, a brilliant cornet player whose style was rooted in chorus-based jazz. Armstrong would take a simple chorus melody and transform it through layers of improvisation, inspiring generations of musicians who followed.\n\nAs jazz continued to develop through the mid-twentieth century, it influenced newer genres. Rock and rhythm and blues both emerged during the same era, drawing on the energy and spontaneity that jazz had introduced to American music. Although these newer forms took popular music in different directions, they shared with jazz a deep connection to performance and personal expression.",
