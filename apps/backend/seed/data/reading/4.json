    "passage": "The continents we live on today have not always existed in their present form. According to geoscientists, the continents first rose above the oceans approximately three billion years ago. Unlike the thin crust that lies beneath the ocean floor, continental crust is remarkably thick — roughly five times thicker than that of the ocean floor. This thick, less-dense crust is what allows the continents to float high above the surrounding seafloor, rising about two and a half miles on average. However, exactly when and how this continental crust formed remains a subject of considerable debate among researchers.\n\n(A) To shed light on this question — that is, to clarify the process by which continents came into being — scientists have studied the chemical composition of ancient rocks. The crust of the seafloor is formed through volcanic activity. When volcanoes erupt beneath the ocean, molten rock, or magma, rises to the surface and cools. As this magma cools and crystallizes, minerals with lower melting points solidify first. Through repeated cycles of melting and cooling, the volume of silica in the resulting rock gradually extends, producing lighter, thicker rock that differs significantly from the dense basalt of the ocean floor.\n\n(B) Over time, these silica-rich rocks accumulated into large masses of buoyant continental crust. The thick, buoyant nature of these chunks of crust would have made them rise high above what became the seafloor. To trace the age of these ancient rocks, scientists measure the ratio of rubidium to strontium trapped within crystal structures, since rubidium decays into strontium at a known rate. Such measurements have confirmed that the oldest continental rocks date back roughly three billion years.\n\n(C) One leading explanation for the sudden appearance of so much continental crust around three billion years ago involves plate tectonics — the movement of enormous rock plates across the Earth's outer layer. Some researchers believe that plate tectonics began operating in its modern form around that time, and the accompanying — that is, supplementary — geological processes of subduction and mountain building drove the large-scale production of continental crust. In other words, the movement of these tectonic plates over the Earth's outer layer probably helped form much of the continental crust that we see today. While alternative theories exist, the plate tectonics model remains the most widely accepted framework for understanding continental formation.",
