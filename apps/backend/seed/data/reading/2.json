    "passage": "(A) Every year, thousands of young people from Western countries take time off between leaving school and starting university to volunteer in developing nations. This practice, commonly known as a \"gap year,\" has become a rite of passage for many. More often than not, these volunteers are motivated by a genuine desire to make a difference in the world. However, the attitude towards volunteering abroad is changing as people begin to question whether such trips truly benefit local communities or merely serve the interests of the volunteers themselves.\n\n(B) In recent years, a growing body of research has highlighted the drawbacks of so-called \"voluntourism.\" Commercial purposes may be cleverly hidden under the claim of humane purposes. Some companies market volunteer placements as life-changing humanitarian experiences while generating significant profits. These drawbacks have raised serious concerns among development experts and policy makers. One particularly troubling finding is that in some countries, children are deliberately kept in inadequate living conditions in orphanages in order to attract sympathy and get voluntary contributions from visiting tourists. In extreme cases, children are even recruited from families who are led to believe that their sons and daughters will receive a better education.\n\n(C) Mark Watson, a researcher who has spent years studying the effects of voluntourism, expects to see a positive transformation in volunteers' attitudes. He believes that when young people travel to poorer regions with the right preparation, they can develop a deeper understanding of global inequality. Watson often uses the example of digging wells to illustrate his point. \"Many volunteers arrive thinking they will dig wells for villages that lack clean water,\" he explains. \"But volunteering abroad requires thinking about what is actually needed. Does the village need a well, or does it need trained engineers who can maintain the water system for years to come?\" His message is clear: good intentions must be perfectly matched with practical skills and genuine local needs.\n\n(D) Despite its problems, volunteering abroad is not without value. When done responsibly, the whole process can reveal a real face to poverty and vulnerability, and shift consciousness toward the understanding of a shared humanity. The key lies in ensuring that volunteer programmes are designed around the needs of local communities rather than the desires of well-meaning travellers.",
