    "passage": "The phenomenon of urbanisation has profoundly reshaped societies across the globe, yet its consequences remain a subject of vigorous academic debate. By 2050, nearly 68 percent of the world's population is projected to reside in urban areas, up from approximately 55 percent in 2018. This unprecedented demographic shift carries far-reaching implications for infrastructure, public health, and environmental sustainability.\n\nHistorically, cities have served as engines of economic growth, concentrating human capital, innovation, and cultural exchange in ways that rural settings seldom replicate. The density of urban populations facilitates the efficient delivery of services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation, thereby contributing to measurable improvements in quality of life. Furthermore, the agglomeration of industries within metropolitan regions fosters specialisation, enabling firms to benefit from shared supply chains, knowledge spillovers, and a deep labour pool.\n\nNevertheless, the rapid pace of urbanisation in developing nations has outstripped the capacity of municipal governments to provide adequate housing, transportation, and utilities. Informal settlements, commonly known as slums, have proliferated on the peripheries of megacities in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. Residents of these communities frequently lack access to potable water, electricity, and waste management services, rendering them disproportionately vulnerable to communicable diseases and environmental hazards.\n\nMoreover, the environmental footprint of expanding cities is considerable. Urban areas account for roughly 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, driven by energy consumption in buildings, industrial processes, and transportation networks. The conversion of agricultural land and natural habitats into built environments exacerbates biodiversity loss and disrupts local ecosystems. In response, urban planners have increasingly advocated for compact city models, mixed-use zoning, and investments in public transit as strategies for mitigating the ecological costs of growth.\n\nUltimately, the trajectory of urbanisation will depend on the policy choices made by national and local governments. Cities that invest in resilient infrastructure, inclusive governance, and green technologies are more likely to harness the benefits of density while minimising its drawbacks. Conversely, those that neglect long-term planning risk entrenching inequality and environmental degradation for generations to come.",
