    "passage": "The concept of neuroplasticity has fundamentally altered our understanding of the human brain. Once thought to be a rigid organ whose structure was essentially fixed after childhood, the brain is now recognised as remarkably adaptable, capable of reorganising its neural pathways in response to learning, experience, and even injury.\n\nPioneering research conducted in the late 20th century demonstrated that the adult brain could generate new neurons, a process termed neurogenesis. This discovery contradicted decades of established neuroscientific dogma. Studies on London taxi drivers, for instance, revealed that their hippocampi—the brain regions associated with spatial navigation—were significantly larger than those of control subjects, a difference attributed to the extensive mental mapping required by their profession.\n\nClinical applications of neuroplasticity have proven particularly promising in rehabilitation medicine. Stroke patients who undergo intensive, repetitive physical therapy can recover motor functions that were initially lost, as undamaged areas of the brain gradually assume the responsibilities of the affected regions. Similarly, individuals who lose their sight often develop heightened auditory and tactile sensitivity, reflecting the reallocation of visual cortex resources to other sensory modalities.\n\nCritics, however, caution against overstating the brain's malleability. While neuroplasticity offers genuine therapeutic potential, it does not imply that any cognitive deficit can be overcome through willpower alone. The degree of neural reorganisation varies considerably depending on factors such as age, the severity of injury, and the specific brain regions involved. Furthermore, maladaptive plasticity—in which the brain reorganises in harmful ways—has been implicated in conditions ranging from chronic pain to phantom limb syndrome.\n\nDespite these caveats, neuroplasticity remains one of the most consequential discoveries in modern neuroscience, offering both a framework for understanding human cognition and a foundation for innovative therapeutic interventions.",
