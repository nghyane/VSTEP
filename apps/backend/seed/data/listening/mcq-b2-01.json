    "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. Today I want to discuss the phenomenon of urban heat islands and what cities around the world are doing to address them. An urban heat island occurs when a city experiences significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding rural areas. This effect is primarily caused by the extensive use of concrete and asphalt, which absorb and retain heat far more effectively than natural surfaces like soil and vegetation. In some cities, the temperature difference between urban and rural areas can exceed five degrees Celsius during summer months. Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate this effect. Green roofs, which involve planting vegetation on building rooftops, can reduce surface temperatures by up to 30 degrees. Cities like Singapore and Copenhagen have mandated green roof installations on new public buildings. Another approach involves increasing the reflectivity of urban surfaces through the use of light-coloured materials, a technique known as cool roofing. Research conducted in Los Angeles found that cool roofs reduced indoor temperatures by an average of two degrees, leading to significant energy savings. Tree planting programmes have also shown promising results. A comprehensive study in Melbourne demonstrated that increasing urban tree canopy coverage by ten percent could lower neighbourhood temperatures by up to 1.5 degrees Celsius.",
